Iâ€™m Pavan, the fourth developer to work on this project. Iâ€™ve worked mainly on the Stock and Favorites sections.

If youâ€™re working on this and Iâ€™m still around, feel free to ask me for help. Otherwise, you can reach out to Rehan or Vamsi. If none of us are available, youâ€™ll have to figure things out by yourself.

This is legacy code, and every team member has contributed to it, so be very careful when making changes.

When I was writing this, only Rehan and I knew what was going on. Now even the god might not understand it. ðŸ˜…

Developer Contributions:
Frontend: Mani, Pavan, Rehan
Backend: Gowthum, Rehan, Vamsi, Pavan
If you're working on this, feel free to add your name to the list.

Also, this was my first time working with TypeORM, so if you come across any query-based routes, they were written by me. Good luck! ðŸš€
If you ever come across something completely new and unheard of in your life, that code was written by Rehan. ðŸ˜†
